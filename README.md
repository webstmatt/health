  - the overarching key factor of this site
  - big diagram, interactive, clickable
  - prevention: diet, exercise, sleep, toxins, stress, mental health, genetics, social
  - ie inflammation leads to cancer, alzhemers, etc
  - plastics, mold, insulin, etc lead to inflammation
- Lifespan / age
  - over time
  - by country
  - vs wealth (one country)
  - causes of death
  - vs exercise
  - vs diet
- Cancer rates 
  - diagnosed vs death
  - correlations - sugar, plastic, other inflammation factors
- Happiness / quality of life
  - is it better to have a short, fun life or a long, boring life?
  - correlations

- Oils
  - tldr: olive oil, macadamia oil, avocado oil
  - types of omegas with nice diagram
  - data mine which oils are health
  - studies on oils
  - oil consumption by country vs health
  - is butter health?
  - is animal fat healthy?
  - how does cooking affect oil?
  - how much oil to consume?
- sweeteners cause reactive oxygen species which cause dementia. not sure of allulose, monk fruit and Stevia
- ros vs dementia vs Alzheimer's
  - which countries have most dementia?
  - common traits of those countries
  - mechanics of dementia
- how energy generation works
  - atp adp amp?. atp is fuel.
  - when atp generated they release ros. ros is like toxic fumes.
  - antiox removes ros, becomes bottleneck
  - if too much ros then shut down glucose into mitochondria and generate glicogen, fat instead.
  - ros issue reduces energy capacity. 
  - cortisol causes neurones to burn energy faster
  - energy crisis causes brain fog, irritability, depression. 
  - app is in all cells. needs to stay in solution with energy applied. when lack of energy they form plaques. inflammatory process with damage. neuron cell death. 
  - ros+ alzheimers, atp utilisation+ (stress, fever, etc) increase Alzheimer 

- alzheimers risks
  - air pollution, microplastics, ionizing radiation
  - ultraprocessed foods, fructose, low omega 3, lack of fibre (supress inflammation), emulsiffiers, b vitamins increases ros
