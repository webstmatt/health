- "Health machine"
  - the overarching key factor of this site
  - big diagram, interactive, clickable
  - prevention: diet, exercise, sleep, toxins, stress, mental health, genetics, social
  - ie inflammation leads to cancer, alzhemers, etc
  - plastics, mold, insulin, etc lead to inflammation
- Lifespan / age
  - over time
  - by country
  - vs wealth (one country)
  - causes of death
  - vs exercise
  - vs diet
- Cancer rates 
  - diagnosed vs death
  - correlations - sugar, plastic, other inflammation factors
- Happiness / quality of life
  - is it better to have a short, fun life or a long, boring life?
  - correlations
- Inflammation
  - funny meme
  - over time
  - mechanics
  - link back to the "health machine"
  - how to address each one
- Microbiome

  - my experience
  - elimination steps
  - mechanics
    - inflammation
- Oils
  - tldr: olive oil, macadamia oil, avocado oil
  - types of omegas with nice diagram
  - data mine which oils are health
  - studies on oils
  - oil consumption by country vs health
  - is butter health?
  - is animal fat healthy?
  - how does cooking affect oil?
  - how much oil to consume?
- sweeteners cause reactive oxygen species which cause dementia. not sure of allulose, monk fruit and Stevia
- ros vs dementia vs Alzheimer's
  - which countries have most dementia?
  - common traits of those countries
  - mechanics of dementia
- how energy generation works
  - atp adp amp?. atp is fuel.
  - when atp generated they release ros. ros is like toxic fumes.
  - antiox removes ros, becomes bottleneck
  - if too much ros then shut down glucose into mitochondria and generate glicogen, fat instead.
  - ros issue reduces energy capacity. 
  - cortisol causes neurones to burn energy faster
  - energy crisis causes brain fog, irritability, depression. 
  - app is in all cells. needs to stay in solution with energy applied. when lack of energy they form plaques. inflammatory process with damage. neuron cell death. 
  - ros+ alzheimers, atp utilisation+ (stress, fever, etc) increase Alzheimer 

- alzheimers risks
  - air pollution, microplastics, ionizing radiation
  - ultraprocessed foods, fructose, low omega 3, lack of fibre (supress inflammation), emulsiffiers, b vitamins increases ros

- types of energy
  - fat 10cal/g, carb 4 cal/g
  - carbs inhibit energy generation, less efficient
  - fructose inhibits growth and energy generation
  - processed foods make you shorter

- causes of cancer
  - mechanisms: insulin (it's a growth factor), insulin causes mitochondrial dysfunction, it increases pento phosphate shunt, rambles cycle which is what cancer needs to grow. some cancers can take fructose and feed directly. cancer cells don't have mitochondria, they grow the fastest. 

- microbiome
  - what to eat: diversity
  - resistant starch, soluble fibre, insoluble fibre, polyphenols, fermented foods, omega 3, prebiotic ogliosides, 
  - get at least one of each category per day

- exercise
  - bdnf, neuron growth
  - increases mitochondria
  - reduces dementia
  - doesnt impact weight loss
